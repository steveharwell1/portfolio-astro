	<h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>

	<p>
		I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second
		page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!
	</p>

	<p>
		This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep
		checking back and see how my journey is going!
